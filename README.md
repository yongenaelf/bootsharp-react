Sample web application built with C# backend and [React](https://react.dev) frontend bundled with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

- Run `npm run test` to run frontend unit tests;
- Run `npm run cover` to gather code coverage;
- Run `npm run dev` to run local dev server with hot reload;
- Run `npm run build` to build the app for production;
- Run `npm run preview` to run local server for the built app.
